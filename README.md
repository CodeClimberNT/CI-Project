# Computational Intelligence 2024 - Final Project


## Installation
To show the tree the program require `dot` in the path.
If you are lazy and don't want to spend too much time just [install graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) system wide. Then check if the binary folder of graphviz was added to your path, if not add it manually (when finished you can safely uninstall it)

### Windows 
Add your graphviz bin folder to your path

Example:
```
C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin
```

### Linux
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I think you know how to find and add that program to your path
